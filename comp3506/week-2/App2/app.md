# App 2
### 1.
the difference in optimism vs pessimism in how long a variable operation outcome may take
### 2. 
   - O(n) is the positive runtime bounding  
   - Omega(Ω)(n) is the negative runtime bound.
   - Theta(Θ)(n) is tight bound, it general is the average to most case scenario, and appears when diff O(n) and Ω(n) is small

### 3.
- n^k
- a0
- ???


# Extra Qs
### 1. find a function G(n) such that 3 + log2(n) is O(G(n))
```
find c, n0 > 0 so that whenever n >= n0 f(n) <= c * n

 if n >= 5, 8n + 5 = 9n

set c := 9 n0 = 5 

let n >= 5 then,

f(n) 8n + 5 <= 8n + n = 9n = cn
```
```
(n + 1)(n - 1)
= n^2 - 1




```
