# Cyber-security Overview
## Computer Security definition
- The NIST computer Security Handbook defines the term **Computer Security** as: 
		"the protection provided in order to preserve the integrity availability, and confidentially of information systems"

## The CIA triad

### Confidentiality
- keeping information authorisation 
### Integrity
- preventing improper modification
### Availability
- ensuring reliable access 
### Authenticity
- genuine verified trust
### Accountability
- an entity can be traced

## Computer Security Terminology
- **System Resource (Asset)**
	- Data, Service, System capability, equipment or a facility that a bad actor is trying to take, usurp, or kill
- **Vulnerability**
	- Flaw or weakness in a systems implementation
- **Security policy**
	- rules and practices to protect sensitive Resources
- **Intrusion** 
	- a succeeding attack 
- **Countermeasure**
	- a technique to reduce a thread, vulnerability, or attack 
- **Risk**
	- the probability of a threat being executed
## Attacks and their classifications 
### Alter
#### Passive 
- obtain information/system resources without affecting the system itself
- two types: release of message contents, traffic analysis
#### Active
- altering of system resources 
- Replay Masquerade Modification of messages, Denial of service 
### Origin
#### Internal 
- initiated from inside system
#### External
- initiated from outside system
## Countermeasure to Security Vulnerabilities and Threats  
- **Technical Measures**
	- Access control
	- identification & authentication
	- system and communication protection
	- system information integrity
- **Management controls and procedures**
	- Awareness & training
	- Audits and accountability
	- certification and accreditation
	- security assessments
	- contingency planning
	- personnel security
	- risk assessment 
	- systems & services acquisition
- **Overlapping technical and management**
	- configuration management
	- incident response
	- media protection
## Attack Surfaces
#### Definition 
- the Reachable and exploitable vulnerabilities of a system 
	- Open ports 
	- Services
	- Code that processes incoming data
	- Employees 
#### Surfaces vs Vectors
- Surface is **WHERE** an attacker can get in 
	- refers to all the possible points in a system
	- Focuses on total exposure
- Vectors is **HOW** an attacker gets in 
	- method or pathway used to exploit a vulnerability
